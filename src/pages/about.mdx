# Deniz Terzioglu

I’m a developer with a background in biomedical engineering who enjoys building tools that make complex workflows simpler. I created and now maintain **JupyMD**, an open-source tool connecting Jupyter and Obsidian which has been adopted by the community with over **7,000 downloads** and **140+ GitHub stars**.

I work mainly with **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Python**, and I care about writing code that’s **maintainable** and easy for others to build on. I am active in the **open-source** community as it allows me to improve on the tools I already use, and share the solutions to the problems I face in my day-to-day life.

My interdisciplinary academic background has taught me how to learn quickly and adapt across fields. I am passionate about solving problems through software and continuously improving my skills to create tools that real people will benefit from.
