JupyMD allows the use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). With JupyMD, it is possible to run Python code, create plots and graphics, conduct data analysis, build machine learning models, and do much more, all directly within your notes.

### Who is it useful for?

Obsidian is [one of the most popular note taking apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-note-taking-apps/) of 2025. This was especially apparent during my time in university, as a lot of my peers used Obsidian to take notes.

Jupyter notebooks are arguably the most popular way of integrating code within notes. Apart from note taking, it also has widespread use within academia and industry, especially in the fields of data science and machine learning.

During my master's, I found myself using both of these tools extensively, with no way of integrating the two. JupyMD solves this problem and allows for note taking and code execution all within Obsidian.

The community response has been very positive, as the plugin has over **7,500 users** and **140+ stars** on GitHub as of September 2025. Its user base is diverse, including pharmaceutical researchers, computer scientists, data analysts, and students.

Given its versatility, JupyMD is useful for anyone who wants to learn, experiment, or document ideas by combining notes and executable code in one place.

### How does it work?

The plugin uses the [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework to bidirectionally sync markdown and Jupyter notebooks files. When either file is modified, the respective paired file is automatically updated.

A persistent Python process runs in the background. When the "Run" button on a code block is clicked, the plugin sends the code to this process for execution. It captures all outputs including text, errors, and plots, and saves the results directly into the notebook file.

A React-based code block renderer fetches the code outputs from the notebook file and displays them on Obsidian.
