This project explored the application of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to address the common challenge of limited labeled data in medical image segmentation. The team's objective was to develop and evaluate a pipeline for segmenting eight pelvic structures from 3D MRI volumes, comparing the performance of a semi-supervised approach against a traditional fully supervised baseline.

The work aimed to determine if leveraging a large pool of unlabeled data could produce a model that is as accurate, or more so, than one trained exclusively on a smaller, manually annotated dataset.

## Technical Approach

The team implemented two distinct training methodologies to compare their effectiveness.

A 3D UNet, a well-established architecture for medical segmentation, was trained solely on the manually labeled MRI scans. This served as the performance benchmark.

A transformer-based Swin UNETR model was utilized for the semi-supervised method. It was initially trained on the small labeled dataset. Subsequently, this model generated "pseudo-labels" for a larger set of unlabeled scans. The model was then retrained using a combination of the original ground-truth labels and the most confident pseudo-labels, allowing it to learn from a wider data distribution.

The data processing pipeline, including normalization, resizing, and augmentation, was built using the MONAI framework.

## Results

Upon evaluation, the semi-supervised Swin UNETR achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.859, while the fully supervised 3D UNet baseline scored 0.856.

## Impact

While the margin of improvement is modest, the key finding is that the semi-supervised approach achieved slightly superior performance while requiring significantly less manual annotation effort. This result demonstrates the potential of SSL as a practical and resource-efficient strategy. By effectively utilizing unlabeled data, it is possible to develop accurate medical segmentation models, which can help reduce the development bottleneck and costs associated with expert data labeling.
