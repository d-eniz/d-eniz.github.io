This project focuses on an Arduino-enabled incentive spirometer designed to help partially sighted individuals improve their lung function. The device provides real-time voice feedback based on the userâ€™s inhalation speed, making it fully accessible to users who cannot rely on visual indicators. By guiding users with audio cues, it promotes deeper, more controlled breathing to improve lung health.
Project Overview

Incentive spirometers encourage users to take slow, deep breaths, helping expand their lungs and prevent complications like atelectasis. While traditional devices display results visually, this spirometer leverages an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure inhalation speed, converting the data into volume in milliliters. The device then provides clear voice prompts to guide users through the breathing process:

    Safe Speed indicates optimal breathing.
    Slow Down instructs the user to reduce their inhalation rate.
    Speed Up prompts the user to increase their inhalation speed.

Once powered on, the user places their lips on the mouthpiece and waits for the start prompt before inhaling. The device then measures the inhalation and provides immediate feedback to help users maintain the ideal breathing rate.
How It Works

The system is powered on by pressing a button, and the user is guided through the process with audio instructions. The ultrasonic sensor measures the inhalation volume, and based on this data, the device gives feedback through pre-recorded voice cues. If the inhalation is too fast or too slow, the system suggests adjustments, allowing the user to repeat the process until they achieve the desired speed.
Key Features

    Using the Talkie speech synthesis library, the device provides voice prompts to guide the user, making it fully accessible for partially sighted individuals.
    Along with the device, comprehensive assembly instructions and audio guides are provided.
